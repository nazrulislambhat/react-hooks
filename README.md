## Introduction to React Hooks

React Hooks are a set of functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to simplify the management of state and side effects in functional components.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it. This section will cover how to use the `useState` hook effectively.

## useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook enables performing side effects in functional components. It's commonly used for data fetching, DOM manipulation, and more. We'll explore the various use cases and how to control when the effect runs.

## useContext Hook

The `useContext` hook provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's particularly useful when dealing with global or shared state.

## useReducer Hook

The `useReducer` hook is an alternative to `useState` for more complex state management. It's often used when state transitions follow a specific pattern, similar to how reducers work in Redux.

## Custom Hooks

Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions. We'll learn how to create custom hooks and how they can help in keeping your components clean and organized.
